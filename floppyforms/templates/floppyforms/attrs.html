    When editing this file, please make sure that this file does NOT have a
    trailing newline. That would result in line breaks inside a <input> tag
    which is just ugly in the resulting HTML. The tests will fail if you do so
    by accident :)

    The if case inside the loop basically checks whether "value is not True". But
    django does not support the "is" comparison. Therefore we check something
    like this:

        not (str(value) == "True" and value == 1)

    Which can be transformed into:

        not (str(value) == "True") or not (value == 1)

    Then into:

        str(value) != "True" or value != 1

    Anyone an idea how this can be accomplished any easier?

{% endcomment %}{% for name, value in attrs.items %} {{ name }}{% if value|stringformat:"s" != "True" or value != 1 %}="{{ value }}"{% endif %}{% endfor %}
